Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    Algorithm
    ----------

    The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...

    The series starts with 00 and 11 as the first two numbers in the series. The next number in the series is found by summing the two numbers before it.

    For example:

    The third number in the sequence, 11, is found by adding the two numbers before it (0+1)(0+1).
    The fourth number in the sequence, 22, is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)(1+1).




PHI GOLDEN RATIO

Phi (golden ratio) is the approximate ratio between
 two consecutive terms in a Fibonacci sequence.
The ratio between consecutive even terms approaches
 phi^3 (4.236068) because each 3rd term is even.
So calculate and round the results to the nearest
 integer when calculating the next terms:

 2,8,34,.. multiplying by 4.236068 each time
